			        <aside class="notes">now we ask the question why responsive. It is kinda a no brainer and the previous pictures might've gave it away. but ethan and karn both emphasized the need for RWD early in the workshop before digging deep into the details. that's why I want go over it with you and share what I learned in this work shop.

				        <aside class="notes">
				        	it has grown very quickly since 2008 and now 50% of traffic for many industries come from mobile. however mobile use has not come at the expense of desktop use.

						<aside class="notes">
							we spend about 2.5 hours per day on both desktop and mobile devices. That's the average.. here obviously we spend a lot more time. but notice how it's almost the same amount of time between mobile and desktop

						<footer>http://opensignal.com/reports/2014/android-fragmentation/</footer>
						<aside class="notes">
							in 2014 there was about 18,796 (19 thousand) DISTINCT ANDROID DEVICES. the only thing we can really know is the size of the browser window and that's not always the same as the default size because some apps have embedded browsers.. and these browsers can have different sizes.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/iosandroid.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							then why not just use mobile apps.. mobile apps  offer a seemingly infinite variety of screen sizes, input mechanisms, and functionality so a native mobile app is necessary but also designing for the web is important to capitalize on these advantages of a mobile device. 
							Web provides more growth for marketing that's from a browser over a native mobile app.

						<h2>User Behavior</h2>

						<img src="images/mobiledesktoptask.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							there's a myth called mobile context.. we try to come up with senarios for mobile and desktop while in reality 90% of people start a task on a device then completed on another. how many of you use your mobile device in your office near your laptop because it just works better, or blocked by flo 
							the point is that CUSTOMERS WILL USE MOBILE DEVICES IN EVERY CONTEXT, IF YOU MAKE IT EASY ENOUGH

						<h2>Unified processes</h2>

					<section>
						<img src="images/theoneweb.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							seperate mobile websites (mobile,tablet,desktop) is dangerouse 
							responsive is better than serparate mobile website 
							you don't want to endup with versions of your website and have to update both.
							one content, single url, single codebase, same release schedule, one team (called The One Web)
							many companies like airbnb tried mobile sites and immidiatly moved to rwd.

						<h2>Thinking "Mobile First"</h2>
						<img src="images/pgr1.png" />
						<img src="images/pgr2.png" />
						<img src="images/pgr3.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							you gotta think mobile first. this means you design for the small screen first no columns just one stream. then you have to prioritize the content what goes first what is't displayed. this way we define priority not layout. progressive website as an example.

						<h2>Flexibility in Design</h2>
						<img src="images/designflexibility.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							you have to start with a flexible foundation there's adaptive and responsive. adaptive tends to be like a snap like oas. and responsive is more smooth like progressive.

						<h2>Images in RWD</h2>
						<pre><code>img { max-width: 100%; }</code></pre>
						<aside class="notes">
							now I want to touch one of the tips Ethan gave that I didn;t know about which was about images. Remember RWD is FLUID GRID, FLEXIBLE IMAGES, MEDIA QUERIES. for images to work in rwd all u need is this rule. the layout will take care of the rest

						<img src="images/pagesize.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							the challenge with images that we have a bit of a performance problem. the average page size is 2 mb but 61% is images. it's because we have now retina screens.

						<h2>Compressive Images</h2>
						<img src="images/compress1.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							compressive images is a way to deliver high quality images in half the size. if you take am image and double its size in photoshop and then export it in low quality you'll get the same picture with smaller size but nearly same quality. it could be very helpful for thumbnails and icons.

						<h2>Responsive Retrofit</h2>
						<img src="images/retrofit.png" />
						<aside class="notes">you recode the front end of your website. capital one did this after their mobile m. site failed and 90% of people were bouncing off of it.</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Beta</h2>
						<img src="images/beta.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							opposite end of the spectrum is beta. lunching a website in beta means retaining the main site and lunching a m. site is what they start with then make it to tablet then grow up and take over the desktop. Fidelity did that. you let the user opt in and opt out to try the new website. but it adds technical difficulty 
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pick A Page</h2>
						<img src="images/pickapage.png" />
						<aside class="notes">
							means choosing a page on the website and redsign in it. it seems the safest way for many orgs. microsoft did that and they did it with their home page.. not the best place to start but for Microsoft it worked well because it led to significat visibality in the company and teams and business unites started wanting to use RWD.

					<h2>Responsive is not a project. Responsive is a permanent new way of working.</h2>
					<p>—Scott Kelton Jones, Expedia</p>
					<aside class="notes">I will leave u with this quote. the tools we put in place to do rwd are not tools we use once and put in place for once they change the entire way teams work together forever.</aside>
